###1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return **zero-based indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

> Example:
	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].


###2. Add Two Numbers
You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

> Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
  Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

 
###3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 
>For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.


###4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

###5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.

###6. ZigZag Conversion
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

###7. Reverse Integer
Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

###8. String to Integer (atoi)
Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

###9. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

###10. Regular Expression Matching
Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

> Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("aa", ".*") → true
isMatch("ab", ".*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → true

### 11. Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.



### 54. Spiral Matrix
Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

> For example,Given the following matrix:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
You should return [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5].
